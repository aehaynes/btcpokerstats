# btcpokerstats
Code base for http://btcpokerstats.com




btcpokerstats.com was intended to be a tracker for the now defunct sealswithclubs.eu bitcoin poker site. Since seals is effectively dead I decided to abandon this project, but the code may be useful for building trackers and bots for other poker sites using the Mavens platform.

The repo includes:

	*A Python rebase of ejacobs PHP swc-client-library (https://github.com/ejacobs/swc-client-library)
	
	*A hand parser for sealswithclubs hand histories
	
	*A PostgreSQL database for storing info aggregated from hand histories
	
	*Django code and static media for btcpokerstats.com 
	
	*A bootstrap of ~1.5 million hands recorded from sealswithclubs cash games, Dec 2014 - Feb 2015
	(http://www.4shared.com/archive/oKY3kC0Uba/bootstraphh00tar.html)
	
	
	
	
	
Disclaimer: This was my first time using a few of these tools, especially Django. The code may be ugly/buggy.
